# Least Squares Regression Method

This is a project as a fullfillment of Statistic and Probability's Reading Assignment 4. This project introduces the least squares regression formula with the help from the article in FreeCodeCamp that can be found [here](the-least-squares-regression-method-explained-how-to-find-the-line-of-best-fit). There is a change in the formula, which is to find the slope of the line (I thinks it's not following the standard formula).Overall, a lot of thanks to the author for helping this assignment. I hope you are satisfy with my project ^^~

\*note:
I know that this project is not suitable for a huge amount of data points, since it needs to input every single of them :(. Although it is different than Python that has "pandas" for importing dataset (for the sake of simplicity :D) and matplotlib for plotting chart like line and scatter points, I tempted to use JavaScript. I just want some challenge and want to prove that JavaScript is "able" to do Least Squares Method, of course with the help of Chart.js library to visualize it :).

## Make it run

- Clone the repository
- Make sure you have node js on your computer
- In the terminal install the dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`
